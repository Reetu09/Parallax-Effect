# Parallax-Effect
The parallax effect is a scrolling technique used in web design where background images move slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth and a 3D effect as the user scrolls down the page. This effect enhances user experience by adding a sense of immersion and visual interest. It is commonly implemented using CSS and JavaScript.
